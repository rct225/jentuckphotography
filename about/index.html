		      Inspiration.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    It can strike when you least
		    expect it. For some, it's the result of a word, a
		    feeling or even an experience. For me, and for my
		    photography, inspiration does not manifest itself
		    in simply images but rather moments.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      A few recent sources of inspiration: a proud aunt doting over her newborn niece, a couple who have been together for years but  act as if they're newlyweds, a family doing what they do best -- having fun.
		    </p>

		    <p>
As I continue to evolve as a photographer, I've discovered that some
of my favorite images aren't posed or planned. They're the silly
giggles, the pouty faces and the stolen kisses. They're moments.
		    </p>
		    <p>
I invite you to browse my website and reach out to learn more about my
		      photography and how I can help you capture your
		      own moments.
